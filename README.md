# Kisan Call Center, Rajasthan: Simplified Insights and Recommendations  

## Overview  
As part of a project assigned by my institute, I analyzed data to address a significant social issue. Coming from a farming family in Rajasthan, I chose to focus on understanding and solving the challenges faced by farmers in the state. To achieve this, I requested access to farmer-related queries from the **Indian National Data Portal**. I received the latest year of 2024 query data from the **Kisan Call Center** for Rajasthan. Despite the textual format of the data, I analyzed it and derived valuable insights that could significantly benefit the agricultural community.
